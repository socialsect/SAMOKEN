# Google Analytics 4 (GA4) Setup Guide

## Alternative to Vercel Analytics

If you prefer to use Google Analytics 4 instead of Vercel Analytics, here's how to set it up:

## Step 1: Create Google Analytics Account

1. Go to [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/)
2. Click **Start measuring**
3. Create a new account and property
4. Choose **Web** as your platform
5. Enter your website details

## Step 2: Get Measurement ID

1. In your GA4 property, go to **Admin** (gear icon)
2. Under **Property**, click **Data Streams**
3. Select your web stream
4. Copy the **Measurement ID** (format: G-XXXXXXXXXX)

## Step 3: Install Google Analytics

Add this to your `index.html` head section:

```html
<!-- Google tag (gtag.js) -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-XXXXXXXXXX"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());
  gtag('config', 'G-XXXXXXXXXX');
</script>
```

## Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file:

```env
VITE_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
```

## Step 5: Update Analytics Service

Replace the Vercel Analytics service with GA4 integration:

```javascript
// In src/utils/analyticsService.js
const GA_MEASUREMENT_ID = process.env.VITE_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID;

// Use Google Analytics 4 API or gtag for data
```

## Advantages of GA4:
